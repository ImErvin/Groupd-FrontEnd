# Groupd Web Application
##### By Ervin Mamutov

### Introduction
Groupd was developed as my end of year project for Third Year Software Development. The aim of this project was to combine the knowledge I gained over the 
three years of college and develop an application using new technologies. This is the design document for the web application. There are three parts
to Groupd, the web application, the RESTful API and the mobile application. Groupd was developed by [Tara O'Kelly](https://github.com/taraokelly) and me. I 
was responsible for developing the web application, while Tara was responsible for the mobile application. We both designed a common RESTful API that both of our
applications use to store and retrieve data.

The idea behind Groupd was to design a social network for start up projects, where users can list or join projects that have vacant positions.

### Planning Phase
#### *Technologies Considered*
  * ##### LAMP Stack
    LAMP Stack stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl. Stack basically refers to developing a full-stack application (back-end and front-end) using
    complimentary frameworks/libraries/databaes. LAMP stack showed to be very stable and popular but due to it's decreasing community we decided against 
    it and try to learn a more up and coming technology. Which brings me to MEAN stack.
  * ##### MEAN Stack
    MEAN Stack stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js.
